    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After I wrote that email to somebody to explain c++, I discovered a new study technique!
By trying to explain that subject in a way I thought made sense to someone who didn&amp;#8217;t know it, I ended up understanding the material way better than before.
So in preparation for my Computer Science class, I&amp;#8217;m going explain all the topics we have learned in class so far to you reader under the assumption that you don&amp;#8217;t already know it!
You don&amp;#8217;t have to read everything, but I figure this is a good way to study and keep myself on track!
Also if there are any mistakes feel free to let me know.
Keep in mind I&amp;#8217;m writing this as if you have little to no knowledge on the topics; someone who has only taken introductionary Computer Science clas, but don&amp;#8217;t be offended dear reader
The way I&amp;#8217;m going to structure it is in two parts.
The first part defines and explains why this is a thing, and the second part will show how to actually implement it in code.&lt;/p&gt;
